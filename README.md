# Testing for Supportability

## Intro
Operations are now becoming a key part of the life of a development team.  Teams are often asked to support the code
 that they deploy into the production environment, especially when those applications are deemed non-critical to the
 core business of the organisation.
  
Cloud native applications that run in other people's computers are too often deployed to production without thoroughly
 testing that the application _can_ be supported properly, by the dev team of today or the team that inherits the
  application in the future. 
  
Here I try to lay out what I think are the key activities for a team to perform to help them prove that their code is
 **Supportable**.

## TL;DR

## Logging
One of the most

## Monitoring

## Breaking stuff
