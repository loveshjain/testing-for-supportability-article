# Testing for Supportability

## Intro
Operations are now becoming a key part of the life of a development team.  Teams are often asked to support the code
 that they deploy into the production environment, especially when those applications are deemed non-critical to the
 core business of the organisation.
  
Cloud native applications that run in other people's computers are too often deployed to production without thoroughly
 testing that the application _can_ be supported properly, by the dev team of today or the team that inherits the
  application in the future. 
  
Here I try to lay out what I think are the key activities for a team to perform to help them prove that their code is
 **Supportable**.

## We are all testers
Note that throughout this article I refer to testers not as a profession, but as the person performing an activity.
 She or he may well be a developer, a security consultant, a technical analyst or even a tester, the point is that
 all people involved in the production of code should in the business of quality assurance - we are all testers. 

## TL;DR
Let me cut to the chase and state what must now be obvious - applications must be tested to prove that they can be
 supported. To prove that, testers should be trying to break their applications through Exploratory Testing.  When it
  breaks, if the tester cannot tell easily from observing the application, then there is work to be done.

## Observability
One of the most

## Monitoring

## Breaking stuff
